Enhancement proposals
================================

This repository is the place to propose and discuss functional changes to the _`Mango programming language`.

These are similar to other languages, with names like PEP, SIP, RFC...

The process, for now, is as follows:

* You have an idea for Mango.
* You work out the details, e.g. by thinking through the details, discussing with other members, optionally making a demo implementation...
* You write a proposal as an issue in this repository. If you find the issue box limiting, you can create a proposal rst/md file and link to that from your issue.
* There is a discussion in the Github issue about the merits, possible changes, and priority of the proposal.
* Taking this dicsussion into account carefully, @mverleg makes a choice.

If the proposal is purely implementational, it can be submitted to the _compiler repository. Proposals about the official Mango infrastructure (e.g. the website or package manager) *are* welcome here.

A template for proposals is not yet available.
